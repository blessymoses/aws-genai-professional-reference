Task: generate exam‑oriented learning notes for the AWS service below.

Service/Topic: {{SERVICE AND TOPICS}}

Goal: help answer scenario‑based multiple‑choice questions correctly (not documentation summarization).

OUTPUT RULES (STRICT)
- Focus on decision‑making, trade‑offs, and AWS exam intent
- Explain why this service is correct AND why others are disqualified
- Explicitly call out exam traps, distractors, and “near‑miss” options
- Be concise, high‑signal, revision‑friendly

REQUIRED STRUCTURE

1. Service Framing (Exam View)
- What problem this service uniquely solves in GenAI architectures
- How AWS positions it relative to similar services

2. Core Concepts & Exam Vocabulary
- Key APIs, features, modes, configuration options
- Exact terminology AWS tests
- Control plane vs data plane responsibilities if relevant

3. Supported Patterns & Architectures
Sample:
- Prompt‑based inference
- RAG (retrieval, ingestion, reranking location)
- Agents / orchestration
- Async vs real‑time vs streaming
- Event‑driven vs request‑response
Clearly state:
- What this service DOES
- What it explicitly DOES NOT do

4. When to Use (High‑Confidence Picks)
- Exam‑style scenarios where this service is the best answer
- Tie choices to scale, latency, security/compliance, cost, ops overhead

5. When NOT to Use (Elimination Logic)
- Anti‑patterns
- Scenarios where AWS expects another service
- Explicit comparisons (Do NOT choose this if X → AWS expects Y)

6. Best Practices
- Security (IAM, encryption, data boundaries, PII)
- Observability (CloudWatch logs, metrics, tracing)
- Reliability, scaling
- Responsible AI (Guardrails, evaluations, auditability)

7. Decision Guidance (Answer Elimination)
- Use Service/Topic when …
samples:
- Use Amazon Bedrock instead when …
- Use SageMaker instead when …
- Combine with Lambda / OpenSearch / S3 / API Gateway when …

8. Exam Traps & Common Confusions
- Similar services AWS confuses candidates with
- Parameters that sound similar but differ (e.g., temperature vs top‑k)
- Features that exist but are not used for this scenario
- Options that work technically but violate “MOST cost‑effective / LEAST ops”

8.1 Execution Order & Sequencing (ORDERING QUESTIONS – EXAM CRITICAL)
- Correct step‑by‑step order AWS expects
- What MUST be FIRST and MUST be LAST
- Validation, approval, or quality‑gate boundaries
- Call out traps:
  - Metrics after testing (wrong)
  - A/B tests before test data (wrong)
  - Analysis before automated gates (wrong)
  - Inference before guardrails (wrong)
  - Ingestion/deployment before schema/config (wrong)
- Use explicit language:
  “AWS expects this BEFORE X”
  “Always AFTER Y in exams”
  “Correct steps, wrong order → incorrect”

If part of workflows (RAG, evaluation, governance, CI/CD, agents):
- Map to lifecycle similar to: Define → Prepare → Execute → Validate → Observe

9. Observability, Limits, Failure Modes
- What fails and how it surfaces
- Where errors appear (logs vs metrics vs traces)
- Limits that matter in exams (payload, latency, throughput, timeout)

10. Last‑Minute Revision (5–7 bullets)
- One idea per line
- Optimized for recall (flashcard style)

STYLE
- Bullets > paragraphs
- Short sentences
- Opinionated where AWS is opinionated
- Omit anything unlikely to appear in the exam

FINAL INSTRUCTION
Generate notes optimized for correct answer selection.
Prioritize concepts that appear frequently in exam questions.
